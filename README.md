# LD46 - Keep Them Alive

A short game about taking care of patients in a hospital room.

There is a shortage of ventilators, we only have one for each pair of beds, so you need to be careful to which patient you give the ventilator.

It can be played with keyboard:

* move with arrow keys to move and take care of patients and switch ventilators

or with the mouse:

* just click a bed to take care of a patient
* or a ventilator to switch it
